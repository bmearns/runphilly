I think the breakthrough was that I discovered that wax is an old/obsolete framework ... should just be using mapbox.js, which supports utmgrid in .mbtiles

Should be able  to just create an mbtiles with tilemill, including action and this will include utfgrid to do interaction through mapbox.js
... revisit last layout but redo using mapbox.js/mbtiles/utfgrid
... do utfgrid interaction seperately at first, new mbtiles/simple interaction


... actually does seem like I will need to generate tilejson from mbtiles

{
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
        -105.01621,
        39.57422
    ]
}

osm -> sqlite (and make view based on google sheets) -> mbtiles -> (utfgrid tiles/tilejson) -> mapbox.js

... how much does mapbox cost again?

sqlite w/ trails, parks, etc. -> views -> tilemilll -> mbtiles
how to modify geometries? ... don't, for now?
